    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>40 saltine crackers, smashed</li>
        <li>4 thin slices boneless round steak</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 <p>Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set aside. Place smashed
                crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Step 2<p>Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer to the smashed crackers and
                cover both sides with the crackers using a spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the
                crackers stick better.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3 <p>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom half of the steaks. Cook
                2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue
                to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined
                plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
